	 * the value that is to be stored here
	 * Note: be careful with this, as it returns an unknown type, I was going to cast the result into another
	 * parameter that contained a class reference but it worked without it.
	 * @param label the text to be held for column name ( ie. Team Name)
	 * @param attributeString the name of the attribute to be displayed (ie, tableName) this has to be reflected by
	 *                           in a class that will be placed in the table
	 * @param <T> The type of the object this method is generic
	 * @return
